<!--Dear diary,

Today I'm going to (verb1) in the morning, eat (food1) for lunch, and then fuck around and (verb2) in the afternoon.

The kids like it when I make (adj1) (food2) for dinner, so I'll do that tonight.

Sigyn likes it when I (verb4) so I'll do that before going (adverb) to sleep.

Damn, I already need a nap. Sounds like a fucking (adjective) day!

PS That damn giant is getting far too close to finishing that wall. I really hope I don't end up having to (verb) his horse!

PPS Note to self: sharpen your scissors. Thor's ego is getting way too (adjectiva) and Sif's hair is getting way too long. Something must be done about this!


Thor version:

Dear diary,

Today I feel like punching (name1) and kissing (name2.) (Name3) says I should do neither of these things. (Name4) says that I should do both

Im feeling (adj1)~~ indecisive, so I might fuck around and (verb1) (ad1) instead.

Tonight I shall seek out giants to (verb2) obviously, and then drink as much (beverage) as I can swallow. I will eat more (food) than should be allowed, and then pass out with a full belly and a full heart, next to my beautiful, flaxen-haired wife.

PS I sure hope Sif doesn't wake up bald tomorrow!

//n the morning missing all her hair!

Odin version:

It's happening again. The wolves are still chasing the celestial bodies theiugh the sky, and the world is still (verb that ends in ing) (adverb) toward its inevitable demise.

Huguin and Munin have been (verbendining) all day, and I shudder to think what (adjective) news they might bring me this night.


My eye may be gone, but I can still see the fate of this (adj) world all too clearly. Why, oh why, did I ever drink that (beverage) from the Well of Mimir? Why, oh why, being my own god, have I forsaken me?

PS Loki's being a dick again, and I want to punch him (adverb) in the face. Then again, he did redeem himself with that whole horse stunt, do perhaps I shall gift him (adj) (nouns) for Yule instead.

My existence is frought with perilous choices.-->
